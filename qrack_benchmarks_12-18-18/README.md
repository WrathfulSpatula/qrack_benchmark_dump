CPU benchmarks were run 12-18-18 for two qubits short of the full published benchmarks, on all tests, but all results are within approximately one standard deviation of earlier November/December benchmarks, and nothing was expected to change in the QEngineCPU-based benchmarks. This motivates accepting the QEngineCPU benchmarks from late November or early December into the published results.
